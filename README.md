# Canvas LMS Integration

This is a plugin designed to integrate tasks and assignments from Canvas LMS to Obsidian, helping you manage your academic workload more efficiently. Forked from [this Canvas LMS importer](https://github.com/jordaeday/canvas-task-importer), credit to original author where credit is due.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install the plugin:**
  - Download the `.zip` file, unzip it, and place the extracted folder into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` directory.
2. **Configure the plugin:**
  - Go to the plugin's settings within Obsidian.
  - Enter your school's Canvas link (it should look like this: https://YOURSCHOOL.instructure.com).
  - Enter your personal access token (instructions on how to do so can be found [HERE](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-as-a-student/ta-p/273)). You should leave the expiration date on the access token blank.
